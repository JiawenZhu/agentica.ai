# Bug Analysis Report

## Critical Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug 1: SQL Injection Vulnerability (CRITICAL SECURITY)
**Location**: `app.py` lines 13-17 in `get_user_by_username()` function
**Severity**: Critical
**Type**: Security Vulnerability

**Description**: 
The function uses string formatting to construct SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the username parameter.

**Vulnerable Code**:
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
cursor.execute(query)
```

**Attack Example**: 
An attacker could use a username like `admin'; DROP TABLE users; --` to delete the entire users table.

**Fix**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

### Bug 2: Weak Password Hashing (CRITICAL SECURITY)
**Location**: `app.py` lines 19-20 in `hash_password()` function
**Severity**: Critical
**Type**: Security Vulnerability

**Description**: 
The application uses MD5 for password hashing, which is cryptographically broken and extremely fast to crack. MD5 is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks and can be brute-forced quickly.

**Vulnerable Code**:
```python
def hash_password(password):
    return hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Risk**: Passwords can be easily cracked if the database is compromised.

**Fix**: Use bcrypt or similar strong, salted hashing algorithms designed for passwords.

### Bug 3: Performance Issue - Inefficient Database Search (HIGH PERFORMANCE)
**Location**: `app.py` lines 84-99 in `search_users()` function
**Severity**: High
**Type**: Performance Issue

**Description**: 
The search function fetches ALL users from the database and then filters them in Python code. This is extremely inefficient and will cause severe performance problems as the user base grows.

**Problematic Code**:
```python
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
all_users = cursor.fetchall()
# ... then filters in Python loop
```

**Impact**: 
- O(n) database read for every search
- Unnecessary memory usage
- Poor scalability
- Slow response times

**Fix**: Use SQL LIKE queries to filter at the database level.

## Additional Bugs Identified (Not Fixed in This Report)

4. **Logic Error**: Division by zero in `utils.py` (always divides by zero)
5. **Performance Issue**: O(nÂ²) algorithm in `calculate_statistics()` 
6. **Logic Error**: Incorrect email validation in `validate_email()`
7. **Security Issue**: Path traversal vulnerability in `load_config_file()`
8. **Configuration Issue**: Hardcoded secret key and debug mode enabled
